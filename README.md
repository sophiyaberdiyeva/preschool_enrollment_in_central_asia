# Prediction of preschool education enrollment in Central Asian countries

### Master thesis prepared by Sofiya Berdiyeva, Master student of Hertie School, Berlin, supervised by Dr. Simon Munzert

The project investigates the determinants of preschool education enrollment in Central Asia by integrating individual and structural-level factors within a unified analytical framework. The central research question (RQ) is: 

*RQ. How do child development, family resources and practices, and regional preschool supply jointly predict the probability of preschool enrollment, and how do these relationships vary across local contexts?*

To address this question, the thesis combines microdata from recent Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) with region-level administrative statistics on preschool infrastructure, labor markets, and population characteristics across Central Asian countries (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan). The primary outcome is preschool enrollment during the current school year. The main empirical approach is multilevel logistic regression, which accounts for the hierarchical structure of children nested within regions and allows for simultaneous estimation of individual- and structural-level effects, as well as their interactions.
